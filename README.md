# about `stemproject`
STEMProject is a website that helps young women who want to go into STEM fields (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math) choose a college with a large percentage of women in their desired major. We got our start at Ladyhacks 2014.

# guide to contributing

Is this your first time even looking at HTML? Are you a senior full-stack developer who could completely redesign STEMProject in your sleep? Are you somewhere between those two extremes? If you answered yes to any of those questions, then you're exactly the kind of person we'd love to have on the team.

Here's how to get started.

1. [Create a GitHub account](https://github.com/join) if you don't already have one.
2. Check the [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/ashaindlin/stemproject/issues) to see if the enhancement you want to make/the bug you want to fix already has an entry. If it does, great! Leave a comment on the issue to let us know you're working on it. If not, that's totally fine too - please don't hesitate to create one.
3. Fork and clone the `stemproject` repo. (You can read the official GitHub guide to forking [here](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) if you aren't familiar with the process yet.)
4. Make sure you have the `gh-pages` branch checked out. As long as STEMProject is hosted on GitHub Pages, this will be our main development branch (equivalent to the `master` branch on most projects). This isn't standard, so don't expect to find other open source projects set up this way, but for a little project like ours it works just fine.
5. Create a new branch with a name that briefly describes what you'll be working on, like `add-contributor-bios` or `animate-navbar`.
6. Start hacking!

If you have any questions, please email/tweet at/send a carrier pigeon to me (Alex, the lead developer on the project). The whole point of STEMProject is to help women be safer in tech communities, and that attitude drives the way we treat our contributors. There's no such thing as an unworthy question or an insignificant contribution.

# contributors

**Lead developer and HTML/CSS witch: Alex Shaindlin [@ashaindlin](https://github.com/ashaindlin)**, who chose that name for herself and considers it a salient example of sexism in tech whenever someone assumes she's a boy because of it. Find her at her [personal website](https://ashaindlin.wordpress.com/) (isn't it nice?) or on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/ashaindlin).

**Data wrangler: Kathryn Killebrew [@flibbertigibbet](https://github.com/flibbertigibbet)**, who bravely waded through the dark depths of the [National Center for Education Statistics website](nces.ed.gov) and turned CSV files into something useful.
